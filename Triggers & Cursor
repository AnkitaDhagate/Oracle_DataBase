1. Create trigger before deleting an account [store deleted record value in new table and display both
table].

SQL to create a new table for deleted records:
CREATE TABLE deleted_accounts (
    account_id INT,
    account_name VARCHAR(255),
    account_balance DECIMAL(10, 2),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

SQL to create the trigger:
CREATE TRIGGER before_delete_account
BEFORE DELETE ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO deleted_accounts (account_id, account_name, account_balance)
    VALUES (OLD.account_id, OLD.account_name, OLD.account_balance);
END;

2. Create trigger on account before inserting an account balance
Check whether balance is greater than 500 or not?

CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_account
BEFORE INSERT ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.account_balance <= 500 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Account balance must be greater than 500.';
    END IF;
END;


3. Input roll number of student and display corresponding name, marks college etc. by using cursor

DECLARE student_cursor CURSOR FOR 
SELECT name, marks, college FROM students WHERE roll_number = @roll_number;

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

SET done = FALSE;

OPEN student_cursor;

FETCH student_cursor INTO student_name, student_marks, student_college;

WHILE NOT done DO
    -- Display the results, you might use a print statement or return them in a procedure
    SELECT student_name, student_marks, student_college;
    
    FETCH student_cursor INTO student_name, student_marks, student_college;
END WHILE;

CLOSE student_cursor;
