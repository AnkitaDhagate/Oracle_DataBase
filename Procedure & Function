1. Write a procedure which accept the account number of a customer and retrieve the
balance.
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAccountBalance(
    IN account_number INT,
    OUT balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
)
BEGIN
    SELECT account_balance INTO balance
    FROM accounts
    WHERE account_no = account_number;
END;

To call the first procedure

CALL GetAccountBalance(12345, @balance);
SELECT @balance;

2. Write a procedure which accept the deptno and print minimum salary of employee
working in that department.
CREATE PROCEDURE GetMinSalaryByDept(
    IN dept_no INT
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE min_salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    SELECT MIN(salary) INTO min_salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = dept_no;

    SELECT min_salary AS Minimum_Salary;
END;

To execute the second 
CALL GetMinSalaryByDept(10);


3. Write a function which accept a deptno and check whether it is present in dept Table or
not. If it is present print number of employees working in that department.


CREATE FUNCTION CheckDeptAndCountEmployees(
    IN dept_no INT
) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE employee_count INT;

    -- Check if the department exists
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE department_id = dept_no) THEN
        -- Count the number of employees in that department
        SELECT COUNT(*) INTO employee_count
        FROM employees
        WHERE department_id = dept_no;

        RETURN employee_count;
    ELSE
        RETURN 0; -- Return 0 if the department does not exist
    END IF;
END;



To use the function:


SELECT CheckDeptAndCountEmployees(10);
